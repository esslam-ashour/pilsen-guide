                Pilsen is one of Chicago’s oldest neighborhoods, and a large portion of the neighborhood was designated as an official historic district in 2006. In the early 20th century, Pilsen was predominantly Czech and Slovak. Pilsen even acquired its name from the Bohemians, who named it after one of the largest cities in their home country, Plzeň. Pilsen later became a magnet for immigrants from a number of Eastern European countries including Poland, Yugoslavia, and Soviet Lithuania.

                Today, Pilsen is a predominantly Hispanic community, and for many Mexican immigrants, it continues to be a vibrant home-away-from-home that is only three miles from downtown Chicago. Pilsen’s history of having a strong cultural identity continues and the neighborhood is home to a variety of independent galleries, youth arts programs, local businesses, and community gardens.
